Python project to simulate Cellular automation. <br>

<b>Features</b>:<br>
GPU offloaded rendering(CuPY), GPU-based game update(CuPY), Interactive gamestates(PyGame-CE), customizable view (PyGame-CE), Saving game state evolution as a recording (openCV).
Rendering and game updates offloaded to the GPU (with the help of CuPY, so a CUDA-enabled device is necessary to run the code.) <br>
Interactable simulation, editable with the mouse (with the help of PyGame-CE.) <br> <br>
Yet to implement saving/recording gamestate evolution.
<br>
<br>
Master is the main branch, with working code; alpha is the test branch.
